[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-18)<br>

You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:<br>

difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).<br>
Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.<br>

For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.<br>
Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]<br>
Output: 100<br>
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]<br>
Output: 0<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

n == difficulty.length<br>
n == profit.length<br>
m == worker.length<br>
1 <= n, m <= 10^4<br>
1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 10^5<br>

__Intuition ->Use max heap to get the maximum profit possible for a worker[i] according to its difficulty. Also, sort the worker array in descending order to start for the maximum profit. Doing this will avoid the chance of missing any profit as when the difficulty will be greater than the current capable difficulty, we will be removing the difficulty from the heap.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfitAssignment(vector<int>& difficulty, vector<int>& profit, vector<int>& worker) {
        priority_queue<pair<int,int>>pq;

        sort(worker.begin(),worker.end(),greater<int>());

        int n = profit.size();

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            pq.push(make_pair(profit[i],difficulty[i]));
        }

        int res = 0;

        int m = worker.size();

        int i=0;
        while(i<m && !pq.empty()){
            if(pq.top().second>worker[i]){
                pq.pop();
            }else{
                res+= pq.top().first;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
