Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.<br>

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]<br>
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]<br>
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= s.length <= 10^5<br>
s[i] is a printable ascii character.<br>

__Intuition ->Use reverse().__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        reverse(s.begin(),s.end());
    }
};
```
