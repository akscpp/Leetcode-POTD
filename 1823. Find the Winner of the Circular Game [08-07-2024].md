[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-the-circular-game/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-08)<br>

There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.<br>

The rules of the game are as follows:<br>

Start at the 1st friend.<br>
Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.<br>
The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.<br>
If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.<br>
Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.<br>
Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: n = 5, k = 2<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:<br>
1) Start at friend 1.<br>
2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.<br>
3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.<br>
4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.<br>
5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.<br>
6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.<br>
7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.<br>
8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.<br>
9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: n = 6, k = 5<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: The friends leave in this order: 5, 4, 6, 2, 3. The winner is friend 1.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= k <= n <= 500<br>

__Intuition ->Same as the famous Josephus Problem.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int fun(int n,int k){
        if(n==1) return 0;
        int idx = fun(n-1,k);

        idx = (idx+k)%n;

        return idx;

    }
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        return fun(n,k)+1;
    }
};
```
