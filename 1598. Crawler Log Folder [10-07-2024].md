[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-10)<br>
The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.<br>

The operations are described below:<br>

"../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).<br>
"./" : Remain in the same folder.<br>
"x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).<br>
You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.<br>

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in logs are performed.<br>

Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>



Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.<br>
Example 2:<br>



Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","./","d3/","../","d31/"]<br>
Output: 3<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: logs = ["d1/","../","../","../"]<br>
Output: 0<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= logs.length <= 103<br>
2 <= logs[i].length <= 10<br>
logs[i] contains lowercase English letters, digits, '.', and '/'.<br>
logs[i] follows the format described in the statement.<br>
Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.<br>

__Intuition ->Use a depth variable to keep track. If a "../" is encountered , decrement depth by 1, don't change the depth if "./" is there. For all other cases , increase depth by 1.__

```C++
int maxSquare(int n, int m, vector<vector<int>> mat) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<m;j++){
                if(i-1>=0 && j-1>=0 && mat[i][j]==1){
                    mat[i][j]=min({mat[i-1][j],mat[i][j-1],mat[i-1][j-1]})+1;
                    
                }
                res = max(res,mat[i][j]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
