You are given a 0-indexed array of strings details. Each element of details provides information about a given passenger compressed into a string of length 15. The system is such that:<br>

The first ten characters consist of the phone number of passengers.<br>
The next character denotes the gender of the person.<br>
The following two characters are used to indicate the age of the person.<br>
The last two characters determine the seat allotted to that person.<br>
Return the number of passengers who are strictly more than 60 years old.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: details = ["7868190130M7522","5303914400F9211","9273338290F4010"]<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: The passengers at indices 0, 1, and 2 have ages 75, 92, and 40. Thus, there are 2 people who are over 60 years old.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: details = ["1313579440F2036","2921522980M5644"]<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: None of the passengers are older than 60.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= details.length <= 100<br>
details[i].length == 15<br>
details[i] consists of digits from '0' to '9'.<br>
details[i][10] is either 'M' or 'F' or 'O'.<br>
The phone numbers and seat numbers of the passengers are distinct.<br>

__Intuition ->Extract age and compare.__<br>

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int countSeniors(vector<string>& details) {
        int n=details.size();
        int res=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            int ans=(details[i][11]-'0')*10 + (details[i][12]-'0');
            if(ans>60){
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
