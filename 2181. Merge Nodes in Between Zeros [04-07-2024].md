[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-04)<br>

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.<br>

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.<br>

Return the head of the modified linked list.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>


Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]<br>
Output: [4,11]<br>
Explanation: <br>
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains<br>
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.<br>
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.<br>
Example 2:<br>


Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]<br>
Output: [1,3,4]<br>
Explanation: <br>
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains<br>
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.<br>
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.<br>
- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [3, 2 * 10^5].<br>
0 <= Node.val <= 1000<br>
There are no two consecutive nodes with Node.val == 0.<br>
The beginning and end of the linked list have Node.val == 0.<br>

__Intuition ->Create a new node storing the sum of the numbers between 0.Then , reset sum to 0 for next sum.__

        ListNode* dummyHead = new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode* temp = dummyHead;

        int sum = 0;

        while (p) {
            if (p->val == 0) {
                
                if (sum != 0) {
                    temp->next = new ListNode(sum);
                    temp = temp->next;
                    sum = 0;
                }
            } else {
                sum += p->val;
            }
            p = p->next;
        }

        ListNode* result = dummyHead->next;
        delete dummyHead; 
        return result;
    }
};
