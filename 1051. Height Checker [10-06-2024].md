A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.<br>

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).<br>




Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].<br>


Example 1:<br>


Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: <br>
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]<br>
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]<br>
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]<br>
Output: 5<br>
Explanation:<br>
heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]<br>
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
All indices do not match.<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation:<br>
heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
All indices match.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= heights.length <= 100<br>
1 <= heights[i] <= 100<br>

__Intuition ->Use another vector to store the stored version of given heights array. Now , compare index by index.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int heightChecker(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int>temp=heights;

        sort(temp.begin(),temp.end());

        int cnt = 0;

        for(int i=0;i<heights.size();i++){
            if(heights[i]!=temp[i]){
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
