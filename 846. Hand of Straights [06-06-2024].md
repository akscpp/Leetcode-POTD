Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and consists of groupSize consecutive cards.<br>

Given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize, return true if she can rearrange the cards, or false otherwise.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.<br>

 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= hand.length <= 10^4<br>
0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9<br>
1 <= groupSize <= hand.length<br>
 

Note: This question is the same as 1296: [https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers]/<br>

__Intuition ->Use multiset to kep all the element. Now , traverse the set till it is not empty and count the number of groups possible. If at any point , nect consecutive element is not present in the set , return false.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isNStraightHand(vector<int>& hand, int groupSize) {
        if (hand.size() % groupSize != 0) return false;
        
        std::multiset<int> st(hand.begin(), hand.end());

        while (!st.empty()) {
            int first = *st.begin();
            for (int i = 0; i < groupSize; ++i) {
                auto it = st.find(first + i);
                if (it == st.end()) return false;
                st.erase(it);
            }
        }

        return true;

    }
};
```
