Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: grid = [<br>
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]<br>
]<br>
Output: 1<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: grid = [<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]<br>
]<br>
Output: 3<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

m == grid.length<br>
n == grid[i].length<br>
1 <= m, n <= 300<br>
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.<br>

__Intuition -> Use BFS . Visit a cell and mark it as visited and store all its neighbouring cell (with 1) in a queue. Then go to the next connected cell , mark it visted and repeat the process. If all the connected cells are marked , you have your island. Increment the count only when you encounter an unvisited cell with 1.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void bfs(int i, int j, vector<vector<char>>& grid,
             vector<vector<int>>& vis) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int delR[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
        int delC[] = {0, -1, 0, 1};
        vis[i][j] = 1;
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({i, j});
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int row = q.front().first;
            int col = q.front().second;
            q.pop();

            for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
                int nr = row + delR[k];
                int nc = col + delC[k];

                if (nr >= 0 && nr < m && nc >= 0 && nc < n &&
                    grid[nr][nc] != '0' && !vis[nr][nc]) {
                    vis[nr][nc] = 1;
                    q.push({nr, nc});
                }
            }
        }
    }
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();

        vector<vector<int>> vis(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        vector<int> adj[m];

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (!vis[i][j] && grid[i][j]!='0') {
                    cnt++;
                    bfs(i, j, grid,vis);
                }
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
