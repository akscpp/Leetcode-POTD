Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.<br>

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.<br>

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]<br>
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: nums = [2,0,1]<br>
Output: [0,1,2]<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

n == nums.length<br>
1 <= n <= 300<br>
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.<br>

__Intuition ->Use three pointers to keep track of 0,1,2. If element is 0 ,swap and move both low and mid . If element is 1, move mid and if element is 2 , swap and move high.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0 , mid = 0 , high = nums.size()-1;

        while(mid<=high){
            if(nums[mid]==0){
                swap(nums[mid],nums[low]);
                low++;
                mid++;
            }else if(nums[mid]==1){
                mid++;
            }else{
                swap(nums[mid],nums[high]);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
