[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-18)<br>
You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.<br>

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.<br>

Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>
![image](https://github.com/akscpp/Leetcode-POTD/assets/129672950/c3a3e570-cefc-4719-9da0-cbba0f46e31a)


Input: root = [3,0,0]<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.<br>
Example 2:<br>
![image](https://github.com/akscpp/Leetcode-POTD/assets/129672950/91790e5a-c8b3-40bd-b4bb-e073aea577c4)


Input: root = [0,3,0]<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

The number of nodes in the tree is n.<br>
1 <= n <= 100<br>
0 <= Node.val <= n<br>
The sum of all Node.val is n.<br>

__Intuition ->Use recursion. When node is null , return 0. Ask a node - How many coins did it get from its left and right child.No. of moves will be the sum if these. Now , return the number of extra candies to the parent node.__

```C++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

        if(root==NULL) return 0;
        
        int l = fun(root->left,moves);
        int r = fun(root->right,moves);

        moves+=(abs(l)+abs(r));

        return (l+r+root->val)-1;

    }
    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        int x = fun(root,moves);
        return moves;
    }
};
