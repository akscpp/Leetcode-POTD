[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-28)<br>
You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.<br>

You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.<br>

You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.<br>

Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>


Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]<br>
Output: 43<br>
Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [2,4,5,3,1].<br>
- The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6.<br>
- The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.<br>
- The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8.<br>
- The road (0,2) has an importance of 2 + 5 = 7.<br>
- The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7.<br>
- The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6.<br>
The total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43.<br>
It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.<br>
Example 2:<br>


Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,3],[2,4],[1,3]]<br>
Output: 20<br>
Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [4,3,2,5,1].<br>
- The road (0,3) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.<br>
- The road (2,4) has an importance of 2 + 1 = 3.<br>
- The road (1,3) has an importance of 3 + 5 = 8.<br>
The total importance of all roads is 9 + 3 + 8 = 20.<br>
It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 20.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4<br>
1 <= roads.length <= 5 * 10^4<br>
roads[i].length == 2<br>
0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1<br>
ai != bi<br>
There are no duplicate roads.<br>

__Intuition ->The node with highest degree is assigned with highest importance. Find degree of all the nodes , sort them and calculate the answer.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:

    long long maximumImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        vector<int> degree(n, 0);

        for (auto& it : roads) {
            int u = it[0];
            int v = it[1];
            degree[u]++;
            degree[v]++;
        }

        long long ans = 0;

        sort(degree.begin(), degree.end());

        for (long long  i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ans += (degree[i - 1] * i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
