[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-buy-tickets/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-09)<br>
There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].

Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.<br>

Return the time taken for the person at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2<br>
Output: 6<br>
Explanation: <br>
- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [1, 2, 1].<br>
- In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [0, 1, 0].<br>
The person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0<br>
Output: 8<br>
Explanation:<br>
- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [4, 0, 0, 0].<br>
- In the next 4 passes, only the person in position 0 is buying tickets.<br>
The person at position 0 has successfully bought 5 tickets and it took 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

n == tickets.length<br>
1 <= n <= 100<br>
1 <= tickets[i] <= 100<br>
0 <= k < n<br>

__Intuition->If we use queue , we have to simply simulate the process given in question. For O(1) Space Complexity , we will iterate over the array. For every index <= k , we will add the minimum of the curr element and tickets[k]. For index greater than k , we will add the minimum of the curr element and ticket[k]-1. Ticket[k]-1 because the element occuring after kth index will get their ticket first before kth index (in circular way). So , the have to take one less ticket to let kth index take his last ticket.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int timeRequiredToBuy(vector<int>& tickets, int k) {
        int n  = tickets.size();
        // queue<int>q;
        // for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        //     q.push(i);
        // }

        int cnt=0;

        // while(q.size()>=1){
        //     int x = q.front();
        //     tickets[x]--;
        //     cnt++;
        //     q.pop();
        //     if(tickets[x]>0){
        //         q.push(x);
        //     }
        //     if(tickets[k]==0){
        //         break;
        //     }
        // }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(i<=k){
                cnt+=min(tickets[i],tickets[k]);
            }else{
                cnt+=min(tickets[i],tickets[k]-1);
            }
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
```
