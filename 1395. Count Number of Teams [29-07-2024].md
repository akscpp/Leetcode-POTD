There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.<br>

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:<br>

Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).<br>
A team is valid if: (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).<br>
Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). <br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: rating = [2,1,3]<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]<br>
Output: 4<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

n == rating.length<br>
3 <= n <= 1000<br>
1 <= rating[i] <= 10^5<br>
All the integers in rating are unique.<br>

__Intuition ->For an index i , count the smaller elements to the left and greater elements to the right of arr[i].Multiplication of these counts will give number of valid teams.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numTeams(vector<int>& rating) {
        int n = rating.size();

        int teams = 0;

        for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {

            int countSmallerLeft = 0;
            int countLargerLeft = 0;
            int countSmallerRight = 0;
            int countLargerRight = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                if (rating[i] < rating[j]) {
                    countSmallerLeft++;
                } else if (rating[i] > rating[j]) {
                    countLargerLeft++;
                }
            }

            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                if (rating[j] < rating[k]) {
                    countLargerRight++;
                } else if (rating[j] > rating[k]) {
                    countSmallerRight++;
                }
            }

            teams += (countLargerLeft * countSmallerRight) +
                     (countSmallerLeft * countLargerRight);
        }

        return teams;
    }
};
```
