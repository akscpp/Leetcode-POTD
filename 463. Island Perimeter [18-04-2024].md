[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-18)<br>
You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.<br>

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).<br>

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. <br>Determine the perimeter of the island.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>


Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]<br>
Output: 16<br>
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: grid = [[1]]<br>
Output: 4<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: grid = [[1,0]]<br>
Output: 4<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

row == grid.length<br>
col == grid[i].length<br>
1 <= row, col <= 100<br>
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.<br>
There is exactly one island in grid.<br>

__Intuition -> Go to each cell and observe its neighbouring 4 cells. If the neighbouring cell is water or out of bound , we have one side to be included in perimeter. If the neighbouring cell is land ,  don't take it into consideration.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int row = grid.size();
        int col = grid[0].size();

        int perimeter = 0;

        int delR[]={-1,0,1,0};
        int delC[]={0,-1,0,1};

        for(int i=0;i<row;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<col;j++){
                if(grid[i][j]!=0){
                    for(int k=0;k<4;k++){
                        int nr = i + delR[k];
                        int nc = j + delC[k];
                        
                        if(nr<0 || nr>=row || nc<0 || nc>=col){
                            perimeter++;
                        }
                        if(nr>=0 && nr<row && nc>=0 && nc<col && grid[nr][nc]!=1){
                            perimeter++;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

        }
        return perimeter;
    }
};
```
