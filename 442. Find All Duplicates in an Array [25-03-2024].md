[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-25)<br>

Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.<br>

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]<br>
Output: [2,3]<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: nums = [1,1,2]<br>
Output: [1]<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: nums = [1]<br>
Output: []<br>
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= n
Each element in nums appears once or twice.

__Intuition-> Use ( array element-1) as indices and mark that element index as -ve. While doing so , if we encounter that the element at array[currentIndex-1]<0 , then the element at current index is repeated.____
__We can iterate through the array and use each element as an index to mark the corresponding element as negative. If we encounter an element that is already negative, it means we have seen it before and it's a duplicate.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();

        vector<int>ans;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            int x = abs(nums[i]);
            if(nums[x-1]<0){
                ans.push_back(x);
            }else{
                nums[x-1]*=-1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
