There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.<br>

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.<br>

Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.<br>

Example 1:<br>
![image](https://github.com/akscpp/Leetcode-POTD/assets/129672950/c0a5a48d-3ade-4ff2-b7ff-3d5c1011601f)<br>


Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3<br>
Output: 13<br>
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.<br>
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.<br>
Example 2:<br>
![image](https://github.com/akscpp/Leetcode-POTD/assets/129672950/b5ea4a5e-d47d-4b75-8b81-22ba5b4fc625)<br>


Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4<br>
Output: 19<br>
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. <br>
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= numBottles <= 100<br>
2 <= numExchange <= 100<br>

__Intuition ->Initially, drink all the full bottles, turning them into empty ones. While the number of empty bottles is sufficient to exchange for full ones, keep trading and drinking the new bottles. Repeat until no more exchanges are possible, maximizing the total bottles consumed.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int consumed = numBottles;
        int emptyBottles = numBottles;

        while(emptyBottles>=numExchange){
            int extraBottles = emptyBottles/numExchange;
            int remain = emptyBottles%numExchange;

            consumed+=extraBottles;

            emptyBottles = remain + extraBottles;

        }

        return consumed;
    }
};
```
