[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-17)<br>
Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.<br>

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).<br>

 

Example 1:<br>
![image](https://github.com/akscpp/Leetcode-POTD/assets/129672950/c9446e40-9829-4c62-aa06-a807d8169130)<br>
Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2<br>
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]<br>
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).<br>
Example 2:<br>
![image](https://github.com/akscpp/Leetcode-POTD/assets/129672950/2c0c5661-2e17-41cb-9fbe-4591828a1250)<br>
Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3<br>
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]<br>
Example 3:<br>
![image](https://github.com/akscpp/Leetcode-POTD/assets/129672950/d04e9ff3-5516-4f0a-9080-78be4ced39d4)<br>
Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2<br>
Output: [1]<br>
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].<br>
1 <= Node.val, target <= 1000<br>

__Intuition ->Use Recursion. First traverse the left subtree , do to leaf node and check its value. If the value matches the target , return NULL. If not , return root. Similarly , do with right subtree . At last, return root.__

```C++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left),
 * right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return NULL;

        root->left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
        root->right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);

        if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL) {

            if (root->val == target) {
                return NULL;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```
