[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-28)<br>
You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.

You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.<br>



 

Example 1:<br>

Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd".<br>
That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
Example 2:<br>

Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= s.length <= 10^5<br>
t.length == s.length<br>
0 <= maxCost <= 10^6<br>
s and t consist of only lowercase English letters.<br>

__Intuition ->Use sliding window technique to keep track of current cost. If current cost becomes greater than maxCost , shrink the window.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        int n = s.length();
        int res = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int cost = 0;

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cost += abs(s[j] - t[j]);

            while (cost > maxCost) {
                cost -= abs(s[i] - t[i]);
                i++;
            }

            res = max(res, j - i + 1);
        }

        return res;
    }
};

```
