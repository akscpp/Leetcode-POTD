Given a sorted integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.<br>

Return the minimum number of patches required.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation:<br>
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.<br>
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].<br>
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].<br>
So we only need 1 patch.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20<br>
Output: 2<br><br>
Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].
Example 3:<br>

Input: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5<br>
Output: 0<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= nums.length <= 1000<br>
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4<br>
nums is sorted in ascending order.<br>
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1<br>

__Intuition ->Maintain a variable maxReach to track the largest sum that can be formed with the current elements, and iterates through the array. If the next element in the array can extend maxReach, it adds the element to maxReach. If not, it "patches" the array by adding maxReach + 1 to maxReach, incrementing the patch count. This process continues until maxReach covers the range up to n. The result is the number of patches needed to cover the entire range from 1 to n.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minPatches(vector<int>& nums, int n) {
        long long maxReach = 0;

        int patch = 0;

        int i = 0;

        while (maxReach < n) {
            if (i<nums.size() && nums[i] <= maxReach + 1) {
                maxReach += nums[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                maxReach += (maxReach + 1);
                patch++;
            }
        }

        return patch;
    }
};
```
