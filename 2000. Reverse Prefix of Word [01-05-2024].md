Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.<br>

For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"<br>
Output: "dcbaefd"<br>
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"<br>
Output: "zxyxxe"<br>
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.<br>
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"<br>
Output: "abcd"<br>
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.<br>
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= word.length <= 250<br>
word consists of lowercase English letters.<br>
ch is a lowercase English letter.<br>

__Intuition -> First and foremost , find the index of the given character. If not present , return the string as it is. If the character is present ,  reverse the string from 0 to idx.__ 

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void reverse(int start,int end,string& word){

        while(start<=end){
            swap(word[start],word[end]);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
    string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
        int n = word.length();
        int idx = -1;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(word[i]==ch){
                idx=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(idx==-1) return word;
        reverse(0,idx,word);
        return word;
    }
};
```
