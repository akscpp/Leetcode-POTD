[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-24)<br>

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]<br>
Output: 2<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]<br>
Output: 3<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= n <= 10^5<br>
nums.length == n + 1<br>
1 <= nums[i] <= n<br>
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.<br>
 

Follow up:<br>

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?<br>
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?<br>


__Intuition -> Use Floyd warshall algorithm (hare and tortoise). Use two pointers slow and fast. Move slow by one and fast by two. Run loop till slow does not become equal to fast. When they meet, bring slow back to 0th index and again move slow and fast but this time, move them by one.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n =nums.size();

        int slow = nums[0];
        int fast = nums[0];
        do{
            slow=nums[slow];
            fast=nums[nums[fast]];
        }while(slow!=fast);
        slow = nums[0];
        while(slow!=fast){
            slow=nums[slow];
            fast=nums[fast];
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
```
