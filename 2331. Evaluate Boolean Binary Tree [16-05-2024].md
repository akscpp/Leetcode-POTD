[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-boolean-binary-tree/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-16)<br>
You are given the root of a full binary tree with the following properties:<br>

Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True.<br>
Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND.<br>
The evaluation of a node is as follows:<br>

If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e. True or False.<br>
Otherwise, evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.<br>
Return the boolean result of evaluating the root node.<br>

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children.<br>

A leaf node is a node that has zero children.<br>

 

Example 1:
![image](https://github.com/akscpp/Leetcode-POTD/assets/129672950/c7bbb41e-dbcc-4e02-9983-4c9afd922734)


Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: The above diagram illustrates the evaluation process.<br>
The AND node evaluates to False AND True = False.<br>
The OR node evaluates to True OR False = True.<br>
The root node evaluates to True, so we return true.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: root = [0]<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: The root node is a leaf node and it evaluates to false, so we return false.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].<br>
0 <= Node.val <= 3<br>
Every node has either 0 or 2 children.<br>
Leaf nodes have a value of 0 or 1.<br>
Non-leaf nodes have a value of 2 or 3.<br>

__Intuition ->Start evaluating from the bottom. First reach the leaf node and return the desired value (bool). Then , if the current node is not leaf , evalutate the returned values from left subtree and right subtree according to the current node's value.__

```C++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool evaluateTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL){
            if(root->val==1) return true;
            return false;
        }
        bool leftT = evaluateTree(root->left);
        bool rightT = evaluateTree(root->right);

        if(root->val==2){
            return leftT || rightT;
        }else return leftT && rightT;
    }
};
```
