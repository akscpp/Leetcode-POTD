Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]<br>
Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]<br>
Output: ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]<br>
Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]<br>
Output: []<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= s.length <= 20<br>
1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000<br>
1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10<br>
s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.<br>
All the strings of wordDict are unique.<br>
Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't exceed 10^5.<br>

__Intuition ->Use backtracking. Store the wordDict in a set. Now , while traversing , keep adding the characters and check if the word formed is present in the set . If it is present , then include it in the current answer so far and move to next index.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void solve(int ind, string& curr, string& s, vector<string>& res, unordered_set<string>& st) {
        if (ind >= s.length()) {
            res.push_back(curr);
            return;
        }

        for (int j = ind; j < s.length(); j++) {
            string temp = s.substr(ind, j - ind + 1);

            if (st.count(temp)) {
                string tempS = curr;
                if (!curr.empty()) {
                    curr += " ";
                }
                curr += temp;

                solve(j + 1, curr, s, res, st);

                curr = tempS;
            }
        }
    }

    vector<string> wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
        string curr = "";
        vector<string> res;
        unordered_set<string> st(wordDict.begin(), wordDict.end());
        solve(0, curr, s, res, st);
        return res;
    }
};

```
