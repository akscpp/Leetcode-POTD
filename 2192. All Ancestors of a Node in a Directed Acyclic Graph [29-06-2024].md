[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-29)<br>

You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).<br>

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from fromi to toi in the graph.<br>

Return a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.<br>

A node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: n = 8, edgeList = [[0,3],[0,4],[1,3],[2,4],[2,7],[3,5],[3,6],[3,7],[4,6]]<br>
Output: [[],[],[],[0,1],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,2,3]]<br>
Explanation:<br>
The above diagram represents the input graph.<br>
- Nodes 0, 1, and 2 do not have any ancestors.<br>
- Node 3 has two ancestors 0 and 1.<br>
- Node 4 has two ancestors 0 and 2.<br>
- Node 5 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 3.<br>
- Node 6 has five ancestors 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.<br>
- Node 7 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]<br>
Output: [[],[0],[0,1],[0,1,2],[0,1,2,3]]<br>
Explanation:<br>
The above diagram represents the input graph.<br>
- Node 0 does not have any ancestor.<br>
- Node 1 has one ancestor 0.<br>
- Node 2 has two ancestors 0 and 1.<br>
- Node 3 has three ancestors 0, 1, and 2.<br>
- Node 4 has four ancestors 0, 1, 2, and 3.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= n <= 1000<br>
0 <= edges.length <= min(2000, n * (n - 1) / 2)<br>
edges[i].length == 2<br>
0 <= fromi, toi <= n - 1<br>
fromi != toi<br>
There are no duplicate edges.<br>
The graph is directed and acyclic.<br>

__Intuition ->Reverse the graph. make u--->v to v--->u . Now , perform DFS . The subsequent nodes will be the ancestors of the current node.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void DFS(int u ,vector<int>adj[],vector<bool>&visited ){
        for(auto &it:adj[u]){
            if(visited[it]==false){
                visited[it]=true;
                DFS(it,adj,visited);
            }
        }
    }
    vector<vector<int>> getAncestors(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<int>adj[n+1];

        vector<vector<int>>result;

        for(auto &i:edges){
            int u = i[0];
            int v = i[1];
            adj[v].push_back(u);
        }

        for(int u=0;u<n;u++){

            vector<int>ancestors;
            vector<bool>visited(n,false);
            DFS(u,adj,visited);
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                if(visited[i]==true){
                    ancestors.push_back(i);
                }
            }
            result.push_back(ancestors);
        }
        return result;

    }
};
```
