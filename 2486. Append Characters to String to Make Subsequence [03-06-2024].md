[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-03)<br>

You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"<br>
Output: 5<br>
Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5<br>
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.<br>

__Intuition ->Use two pointers to keep track of same characters in both strings. Whenever there is a mismatch , move the ponter to next index in the "s" string to locate next matching element.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int appendCharacters(string s, string t) {
        int n = s.length();
        int N = t.length();

        int i=0,j=0;

        while(i<n && j<N){
            if(s[i]==t[j]){
                i++;j++;
            }else{
                i++;
            }
        }

        if(i==n){
            return N-j;
        }

        return 0;
    }
};
```
