In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at position[i], Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.<br>

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.<br>

Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>
![image](https://github.com/akscpp/Leetcode-POTD/assets/129672950/a2ad755b-64f0-4a02-bd91-fb6a92e08a04)<br>

Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2<br>
Output: 999999999<br>
Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

n == position.length<br>
2 <= n <= 10^5<br>
1 <= position[i] <= 10^9<br>
All integers in position are distinct.<br>
2 <= m <= position.length<br>

__Intuition ->Use binary search on the magnetic force to find the minimum magnetic force that is maximum.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& position, int m , int mid){
        int cnt = 1;
        int last = 0;

        int n = position.size();

        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(position[i]-position[last]>=mid){
                cnt++;
                last = i;
            }
        }

        return (cnt>=m);
    }
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
        sort(position.begin(),position.end());

        int n = position.size();

        int low = 1;
        int high = position[n-1]-position[0];

        int res = -1;

        while(low<=high){
            int mid = low+ (high-low)/2;

            if(isPossible(position,m,mid)){
                res = mid;
                low = mid+1;
            }else{
                high = mid-1;
            }
        }

        return (res==-1)?-1:res;
    }
};
```
