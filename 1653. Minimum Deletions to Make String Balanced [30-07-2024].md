[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-balanced/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-30)<br>

You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.<br>

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.<br>

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: s = "aababbab"<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: You can either:<br>
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or<br>
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= s.length <= 10^5<br>
s[i] is 'a' or 'b'​​.<br>

__Intuition ->Use stack to keep track of a and b. If current character and top of stack differs, pop the character from the stack and increase the count by 1.If not, then push the current character in the stack.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        stack<char> st;
        int cnt = 0;
        st.push(s[0]);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (!st.empty() && s[i]=='a' && st.top()=='b') {
                st.pop();
                cnt++;
            }else{
                st.push(s[i]);
            }
            
        }
        return cnt;
    }

}
;
```
