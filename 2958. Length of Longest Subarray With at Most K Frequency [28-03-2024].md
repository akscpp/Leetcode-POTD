[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-subarray-with-at-most-k-frequency/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-28)<br>
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

The frequency of an element x is the number of times it occurs in an array.<br>

An array is called good if the frequency of each element in this array is less than or equal to k.<br>

Return the length of the longest good subarray of nums.<br>

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2], k = 2<br>
Output: 6<br>
Explanation: The longest possible good subarray is [1,2,3,1,2,3] since the values 1, 2, and 3 occur at most twice in this subarray. Note that the subarrays [2,3,1,2,3,1] and [3,1,2,3,1,2] are also good.
It can be shown that there are no good subarrays with length more than 6.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2], k = 1<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: The longest possible good subarray is [1,2] since the values 1 and 2 occur at most once in this subarray. Note that the subarray [2,1] is also good.
It can be shown that there are no good subarrays with length more than 2.<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: nums = [5,5,5,5,5,5,5], k = 4<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: The longest possible good subarray is [5,5,5,5] since the value 5 occurs 4 times in this subarray.
It can be shown that there are no good subarrays with length more than 4.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5<br>
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9<br>
1 <= k <= nums.length<br>

__Intuition -> Use sliding window approach and a map to store frequency of elements. Keep iterating the array until you don't encounter an array element whose frequenct is greater than k. When frequency becomes greater than k , reduce the frequency from the 0-th index and keep moving forward until you don't make the frequency of current element less than or equal to k. For length , use i-j+1.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubarrayLength(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        unordered_map<int,int>mp;
        int ans=-1e9;
        int i=0,j=0;
        while(i<n){
            mp[nums[i]]++;
            
            while(mp[nums[i]]>k && j<i){
                mp[nums[j]]--;
                j++;
            }
            // if(mp[nums[i]]<=k){
                ans=max(ans,i-j+1);
            // }
            i++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
