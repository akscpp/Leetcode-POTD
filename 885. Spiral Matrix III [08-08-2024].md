You start at the cell (rStart, cStart) of an rows x cols grid facing east. The northwest corner is at the first row and column in the grid, and the southeast corner is at the last row and column.<br>

You will walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. Whenever you move outside the grid's boundary, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid boundary later.). Eventually, we reach all rows * cols spaces of the grid.<br>

Return an array of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order you visited them.<br>

Constraints:<br>

1 <= rows, cols <= 100<br>
0 <= rStart < rows<br>
0 <= cStart < cols<br>

__Intuition ->This solution simulates a spiral traversal on a matrix by moving in four directions: east, south, west, and north. It increases the number of steps after every two direction changes (east/west), ensuring that the entire matrix is covered. The algorithm keeps track of valid positions within bounds and returns the spiral order of matrix coordinates.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> spiralMatrixIII(int rows, int cols, int rStart,
                                        int cStart) {
        vector<vector<int>> directions = {
            {0, 1},  // EAST
            {1, 0},  // SOUTH
            {0, -1}, // WEST
            {-1, 0}  // NORTH
        };

        vector<vector<int>> result;
        int step = 0; // how much steps to move
        int dir = 0;  // Which direction

        result.push_back({rStart, cStart});

        while (result.size() < rows * cols) {
            // When we move EAST or WEST, we need to increase our steps by 1
            if (dir == 0 || dir == 2)
                step++;

            for (int i = 0; i < step; i++) {
                rStart += directions[dir][0];
                cStart += directions[dir][1];

                if (rStart >= 0 && rStart < rows && cStart >= 0 &&
                    cStart < cols) // check valid
                    result.push_back({rStart, cStart});
            }

            dir = (dir + 1) % 4; // turn to next direction
        }
        return result;
    }
};

```
