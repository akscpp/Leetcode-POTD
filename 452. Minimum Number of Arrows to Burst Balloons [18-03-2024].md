There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.<br>

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.<br>

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:<br>
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].<br>
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:<br>
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].<br>
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= points.length <= 10^5<br>
points[i].length == 2<br>
-2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1<br>
__Intuition-> Use variabe end to keep track of end point of interval. Iterate from 1st position of points array and compare points[i][0] (first point of current) with end (end point of last interval point). If current starting point is greater than end , increment count and update end to current interval's end point.__


```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n=points.size();
        int cnt=1;
        sort(points.begin(),points.end());
        int end = points[0][1];
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(points[i][0]>end){
                cnt++;
                end = points[i][1];
            }else{
                end=min(end,points[i][1]);
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
