[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-ideal-subsequence/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-25)<br>

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase letters and an integer k. We call a string t ideal if the following conditions are satisfied:<br>

t is a subsequence of the string s.<br>
The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two adjacent letters in t is less than or equal to k.<br>
Return the length of the longest ideal string.<br>

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.<br>

Note that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet order of 'a' and 'z' is 25, not 1.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: s = "acfgbd", k = 2<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: The longest ideal string is "acbd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.<br>
Note that "acfgbd" is not ideal because 'c' and 'f' have a difference of 3 in alphabet order.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: s = "abcd", k = 3<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: The longest ideal string is "abcd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= s.length <= 10^5<br>
0 <= k <= 25<br>
s consists of lowercase English letters.<br>

__Intuition -> Same like longest increasing subsequence problem . Only difference is that here , we are checking the absolute difference between elements. LIS approach will give TLE as we will be visiting those characters also , whose absolute difference with curr character is greater than k. INSTEAD , we will use a 26 size array and visit only those elements which are at +k and -k distance always from the current element.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestIdealString(string s, int k) {
        // int n = s.length();
        // vector<int>t(n,1);

        // int res = 1;

        // for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        //     for(int j=i-1;j>=0;j--){
        //         if(abs(s[i]-s[j])<=k){
        //             t[i]=max(t[i],t[j]+1);
        //         }
        //     }
        //     res = max(res,t[i]);
        // }
        // return res;

        int n = s.length();
        int result=0;
        vector<int>t(26,0);

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            int currInd = s[i]-'a';
            int leftInd = max(0,currInd-k);
            int rightInd = min(25,currInd+k);

            int longest= 0;
            for(int j=leftInd;j<=rightInd;j++){
                longest = max(longest,t[j]);
            }
            t[currInd] = max(t[currInd],longest+1);
            result = max(result,t[currInd]);

        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
