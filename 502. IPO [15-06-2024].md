Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.<br>

You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.<br>

Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.<br>

Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.<br>

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.<br>
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.<br>
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.<br>
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.<br>
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]<br>
Output: 6<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= k <= 10^5<br>
0 <= w <= 10^9<br>
n == profits.length<br>
n == capital.length<br>
1 <= n <= 10^5<br>
0 <= profits[i] <= 10^4<br>
0 <= capital[i] <= 10^9<br>

__Intuition -> The solution maximizes the capital by first sorting the projects based on their capital requirements, allowing efficient identification of feasible projects. A max-heap is then used to keep track of the most profitable projects that can be started with the current capital. For each of the k selections, projects that can be started are added to the heap, and the most profitable one is chosen, updating the capital accordingly. This ensures that the most profitable projects are always selected, maximizing the total capital after completing up to k projects.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, vector<int>& profits,
                             vector<int>& capital) {
        int n = profits.size();
        vector<pair<int, int>> temp(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            temp[i] = make_pair(capital[i], profits[i]);
        }
        sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());

        int i = 0;
        priority_queue<int> pq;

        while (k--) {

            while (i < n && temp[i].first <= w) {
                pq.push(temp[i].second);
                i++;
            }
            if (pq.empty()) {
                break;
            }

            w += pq.top();
            pq.pop();
        }
        return w;
    }
};
```
