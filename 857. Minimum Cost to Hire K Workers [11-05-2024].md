[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-11)<br>
There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.

We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:<br>

Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.<br>
In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.<br>
Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2<br>
Output: 105.00000<br>
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0th worker and 35 to 2nd worker.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], k = 3<br>
Output: 30.66667<br>
Explanation: We pay 4 to 0th worker, 13.33333 to 2nd and 3rd workers separately.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

n == quality.length == wage.length<br>
1 <= k <= n <= 10^4<br>
1 <= quality[i], wage[i] <= 10^4<br>

__Intuition ->This function aims to find the cheapest way to hire a team of k workers out of n available ones. The key factors are the worker's quality (skill) and their minimum wage expectation. The cost to hire a worker is simply their wage multiplied by their quality.__
__To achieve this, the code calculates a "worker ratio" for each person, which is their minimum wage divided by their quality. This essentially reflects how much they cost per unit of skill. Then, it prioritizes workers with the lowest cost per skill. It considers the top k workers and keeps track of their total quality. As it iterates through the remaining workers, it ensures only the top k with the highest overall quality contribute to the cost calculation. This way, the function efficiently finds the minimum cost by hiring the most cost-effective workers to build the team.__
