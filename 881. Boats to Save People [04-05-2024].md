[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-04)<br>
You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.<br>

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4<br>
1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 10^4<br>

__Intuition -> Sort the array. Now use two pointers (one at 0th and other at n-1).Now , check if you can place both the weights in the boat. If yes , increase count and move both pointers. If you can place both the weights , place the greater one and move the j-th pointer and increase the count.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        int n = people.size();
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());

        int i = 0, j = n - 1;
        int cnt = 0;
        while (i <= j) {

            if (people[i] + people[j] <= limit) {
                i++;
                j--;

            } else {

                j--;
            }
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
