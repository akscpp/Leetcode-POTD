[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-the-parentheses/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-04)<br>
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:<br>

It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",<br>
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or<br>
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.<br>
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:<br>

depth("") = 0<br>
depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".<br>
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.<br>
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.<br>
For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.<br>

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"<br>
Output: 3<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= s.length <= 100<br>
s consists of digits 0-9 and characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', and ')'.<br>
It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.<br>

__Intuition ->Whenever '(' is encountered , increase the count and update the result . If ')' is encountered , decrease the count.Finally return result.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(string s) {
        int res = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        int n  = s.length();
        if(n==0) return 0;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(s[i]=='('){
                cnt++;
                res = max(res,cnt);
            }else if(s[i]==')'){
                cnt--;
            }
        }
        return max(cnt,res);
    }
};
```
