[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-06)<br>
You are given the head of a linked list.<br>

Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.<br>

Return the head of the modified linked list.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>


Input: head = [5,2,13,3,8]<br>
Output: [13,8]<br>
Explanation: The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.<br>
- Node 13 is to the right of node 5.<br>
- Node 13 is to the right of node 2.<br>
- Node 8 is to the right of node 3.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: head = [1,1,1,1]<br>
Output: [1,1,1,1]<br>
Explanation: Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 10^5].<br>
1 <= Node.val <= 10^5<br>

__Intuition -> We can use recursion to traverse the linked list and at each step, we compare the current node's value with the value of the next greater node. If the next greater node has a value less than the current node, we keep the current node; otherwise, we skip the current node.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNodes(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        ListNode* node = head;
        ListNode* nxtGreater = removeNodes(node->next);

        node->next = nxtGreater;
        if (nxtGreater == nullptr || node->val >= nxtGreater->val) {
            return node;
        }
        return nxtGreater;
    }
};
```
