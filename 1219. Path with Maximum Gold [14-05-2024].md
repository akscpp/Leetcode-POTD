In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.<br>

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:<br>

Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.<br>
From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.<br>
You can't visit the same cell more than once.<br>
Never visit a cell with 0 gold.<br>
You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.<br>
 

Example 1:<br>

Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]<br>
Output: 24<br>
Explanation:<br>
[[0,6,0],<br>
 [5,8,7],<br>
 [0,9,0]]<br>
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]<br>
Output: 28<br>
Explanation:<br>
[[1,0,7],<br>
 [2,0,6],<br>
 [3,4,5],<br>
 [0,3,0],<br>
 [9,0,20]]<br>
Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

m == grid.length<br>
n == grid[i].length<br>
1 <= m, n <= 15<br>
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100<br>
There are at most 25 cells containing gold.<br>

__Intuition ->Explore all possible paths from a given cell (row, col) and recursively checks neighboring cells to find the maximum amount of gold that can be collected. Backtarck after exploring each path to ensure all possibilities are considered. The getMaximumGold function iterates through all cells in the grid, invoking fun on each cell to find the maximum amount of gold that can be collected starting from that cell. Finally, it returns the maximum value found.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int fun(int row, int col, vector<vector<int>>& grid, int m, int n) {
                if(row>=m || row<0 || col>=n || col<0 || grid[row][col]==0) return 0;

        int delR[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
        int delC[] = {0, -1, 0, 1};

        int originalGold = grid[row][col];
        grid[row][col]=0;

        int maxGold = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
            int nr = row+delR[i];
            int nc = col+delC[i];

            if(nr>=0 && nr<m && nc>=0 && nc<n && grid[nr][nc]!=0){
                maxGold=max(maxGold,fun(nr,nc,grid,m,n));
            }
        }

        int maxi = originalGold+maxGold;
        grid[row][col]=originalGold;
        return maxi;
    }

    int getMaximumGold(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int maxi = -1e9;

        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            for(int j =0;j<n;j++){
                maxi = max(maxi,fun(i,j,grid,m,n));
            }
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
