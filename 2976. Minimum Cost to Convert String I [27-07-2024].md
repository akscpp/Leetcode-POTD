[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-convert-string-i/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-07-27)<br>

You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].<br>

You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.<br>

Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.<br>

Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]<br>
Output: 28<br>
Explanation: To convert the string "abcd" to string "acbe":<br>
- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.<br>
- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.<br>
- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.<br>
- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.<br>
The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.<br>
It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: source = "aaaa", target = "bbbb", original = ["a","c"], changed = ["c","b"], cost = [1,2]<br>
Output: 12<br>
Explanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: source = "abcd", target = "abce", original = ["a"], changed = ["e"], cost = [10000]<br>
Output: -1<br>
Explanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= source.length == target.length <= 10^5<br>
source, target consist of lowercase English letters.<br>
1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000<br>
original[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.<br>
1 <= cost[i] <= 10^6<br>
original[i] != changed[i]<br>

__Intuition ->Create an adjacency matrix from the array original and changed. Use Floyd Warshall Algorithm to find the least cost from one character to another character.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void FloydWarshall(vector<vector<long long>>&adj,vector<char>& original,vector<char>& changed,vector<int>& cost){
        for(int i=0;i<original.size();i++){
            int s = original[i]-'a';
            int t =  changed[i]-'a';

            adj[s][t]=min(adj[s][t],(long long)cost[i]);
        }

        for(int k=0;k<26;k++){
            for(int i=0;i<26;i++){
                for(int j=0;j<26;j++){
                    adj[i][j]=min(adj[i][j],adj[i][k]+adj[k][j]);
                }
            }
        }

    }
    long long minimumCost(string source, string target, vector<char>& original, vector<char>& changed, vector<int>& cost) {
        
        vector<vector<long long>>adj(26,vector<long long>(26,INT_MAX));

        FloydWarshall(adj,original,changed,cost);

        long long ans=0;

        for(int i=0;i<source.length();i++){
            if(source[i]==target[i]) continue;

            if(adj[source[i]-'a'][target[i]-'a']==INT_MAX){
                return -1;
            }

            ans+= adj[source[i]-'a'][target[i]-'a'];
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
