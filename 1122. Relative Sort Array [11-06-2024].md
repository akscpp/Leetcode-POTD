Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all elements in arr2 are also in arr1.<br>

Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 are the same as in arr2. Elements that do not appear in arr2 should be placed at the end of arr1 in ascending order.<br>


Example 1:<br>

Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]<br>
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: arr1 = [28,6,22,8,44,17], arr2 = [22,28,8,6]<br>
Output: [22,28,8,6,17,44]<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000<br>
0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000<br>
All the elements of arr2 are distinct.<br>
Each arr2[i] is in arr1.<br>

__Intuition ->Use map to store the frequency of elements in arr1. Then , traverse the arr2 and if the element is present in the map , store it into answer array till its frequency in the map becomes 0.After this, traverse the map and collect all the elements whose frequency is not 0 (collect until frequency becomes 0). Then ,sort them and add it to the answer array.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> relativeSortArray(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2) {
        unordered_map<int,int>mp;

        for(int i=0;i<arr1.size();i++){
            mp[arr1[i]]++;
        }

        vector<int>ans;
        for(int i=0;i<arr2.size();i++){
            if(mp.find(arr2[i])!=mp.end() && mp[arr2[i]]!=0){
                while(mp[arr2[i]]!=0){
                    ans.push_back(arr2[i]);
                    mp[arr2[i]]--;
                }
            }
        }

        vector<int>temp;

        for(auto &i:mp){
            if(i.second!=0){
                while(i.second!=0){
                    temp.push_back(i.first);
                    i.second--;
                }
            }
        }

        sort(temp.begin(),temp.end());

        for(auto &i:temp){
            ans.push_back(i);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
