You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.<br>

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2<br>

Output: 8<br>

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.<br>

After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.<br>

Example 2:<br>

Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1<br>

Output: 6<br>

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.<br>

Example 3:<br>

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3<br>

Output: 10<br>

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.<br>

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.<br>



 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4<br>
tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.<br>

__Intuition -> Use priority queue to store the letters by their descreasing frequency of occurrence. We can observe that when we pop one frequency (one letter) , we must do (n+1) operations to again use use that letter. So , time will always be  incremented by (n+1) if queue is not empty.__

class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& task, int n) {
        vector<int>mp(26,0);
        for(int i=0;i<task.size();i++){
            mp[task[i]-'A']++;
        }

                pq.push(mp[i]);
            }
        }

        while(!pq.empty()){
            vector<int>temp;

                if(!pq.empty()){
                    int freq = pq.top();
                    pq.pop();
                    freq--;
                    temp.push_back(freq);
                }
            }
            for(int i=0;i<temp.size();i++){
                if(temp[i]>0){
                    pq.push(temp[i]);
                }
            }

            if(pq.empty()){
                time+=temp.size();
            }else time+=(n+1);

        }
        return time;
    }
