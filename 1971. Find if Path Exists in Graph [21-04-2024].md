[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-21)<br>
There is a bi-directional graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex source to vertex destination.

Given edges and the integers n, source, and destination, return true if there is a valid path from source to destination, or false otherwise.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>


Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:<br>
- 0 → 1 → 2<br>
- 0 → 2<br>
Example 2:<br>


Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0, destination = 5<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5<br>
0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 10^5<br>
edges[i].length == 2<br>
0 <= u i, v i <= n - 1<br>
u i != v i<br>
0 <= source, destination <= n - 1<br>
There are no duplicate edges.<br>
There are no self edges.<br>

__Intuition->Use DFS and pass the starting point as source. The DFS will go till depth and mark all the nodes connected to source (directly or indirectly) as visited. When the dfs ends , check is the destination node is visited or not. If not visited , return false. Else , return true.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int s, int d, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& vis) {
        vis[s] = 1;
        if (s == d) return;
        for (int it : adj[s]) {
            if (!vis[it])
                dfs(it, d, adj, vis);
        }
    }

    bool validPath(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int source, int destination) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);

        for(auto &i : edges){
            int u = i[0];
            int v = i[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u);
        }

        vector<int> vis(n + 1, 0);
        dfs(source, destination, adj, vis);
        return vis[destination] == 1;
    }
};
```
