[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-21)<br>

There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for n minutes. Every minute, some number of customers enter the store. You are given an integer array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of the customer that enters the store at the start of the ith minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.<br>

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array grumpy where grumpy[i] is 1 if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the ith minute, and is 0 otherwise.<br>

When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise, they are satisfied.<br>

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for minutes consecutive minutes, but can only use it once.<br>

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], minutes = 3<br>
Output: 16<br>
Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes. <br>
The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: customers = [1], grumpy = [0], minutes = 1<br>
Output: 1<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

n == customers.length == grumpy.length<br>
1 <= minutes <= n <= 2 * 10^4<br>
0 <= customers[i] <= 1000<br>
grumpy[i] is either 0 or 1.<br>

__Intuition ->Use sliding window o find the window (of size minutes) with maximum unsatisfied customers.Then add it to the number of satisfied customers.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& customers, vector<int>& grumpy, int minutes) {
        int n = customers.size();
        int unsatisfied = 0;
        int maxi = 0;

        for(int i=0;i<minutes;i++){
            unsatisfied+= (customers[i] * grumpy[i]);
        }
        int i=0,j=minutes;

        maxi = unsatisfied;

        while(j<n){
            unsatisfied+= (customers[j]*grumpy[j]);
            unsatisfied-= (customers[i]*grumpy[i]);

            maxi = max(maxi,unsatisfied);
            i++;j++;
        }

        int totalSat = maxi;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(grumpy[i]==0){
                totalSat+= customers[i];
            }
        }

        return totalSat;
    }
};
```
