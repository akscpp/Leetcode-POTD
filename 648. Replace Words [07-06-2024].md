In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".<br>

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.<br>

Return the sentence after the replacement.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"<br>
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"<br>
Output: "a a b c"<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000<br>
1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100<br>
dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.<br>
1 <= sentence.length <= 10^6<br>
sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.<br>
The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]<br>
The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]<br>
Every two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.<br>
sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.<br>

__Intuition ->Store every dictionary array word in a set. Now, traverse the string and check if that word is present in the set or not.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    string replaceWords(vector<string>& dictionary, string sentence) {
        unordered_set<string>st(dictionary.begin(),dictionary.end());

        string ans = "";

        int i=0;
        while(i<sentence.length()){
            string temp="";
            while(i<sentence.length() && sentence[i]!=' '){
                temp+=sentence[i];

                if(st.find(temp)!=st.end()){
                    break;
                }
                i++;
            }
            ans+=temp;
            ans+=' ';
            while(sentence[i]!=' ' && i<sentence.length()){
                i++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        ans.pop_back();

        return ans;
    }
};
```
