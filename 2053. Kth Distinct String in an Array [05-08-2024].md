[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-distinct-string-in-an-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-08-05)<br>

A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.<br>

Given an array of strings arr, and an integer k, return the kth distinct string present in arr. If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an empty string "".<br>

Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2<br>
Output: "a"<br>
Explanation:<br>
The only distinct strings in arr are "d" and "a".<br>
"d" appears 1st, so it is the 1st distinct string.<br>
"a" appears 2nd, so it is the 2nd distinct string.<br>
Since k == 2, "a" is returned. <br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: arr = ["aaa","aa","a"], k = 1<br>
Output: "aaa"<br>
Explanation:<br>
All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1st string "aaa" is returned.<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: arr = ["a","b","a"], k = 3<br>
Output: ""<br>
Explanation:<br>
The only distinct string is "b". Since there are fewer than 3 distinct strings, we return an empty string "".<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= k <= arr.length <= 1000<br>
1 <= arr[i].length <= 5<br>
arr[i] consists of lowercase English letters.<br>

__Intuition ->Store frequency of every string and store only those string whose frequency is 1.__

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    string kthDistinct(vector<string>& arr, int k) {
        unordered_map<string, int> freqMap;
        
        
        for (const string& s : arr) {
            freqMap[s]++;
        }
        
        
        int distinctCount = 0;
        for (const string& s : arr) {
            if (freqMap[s] == 1) {  
                distinctCount++;
                if (distinctCount == k) {
                    return s;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return "";  
    }
};

```
